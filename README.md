## Body-Fat-Calculator

### U.S. Navy Method
The calculator uses a method involving equations developed at the Naval Health Research Center by Hodgdon and Backett in 1984. The method for measuring the relevant body parts as well as the specific equations used are provided:

- Measure the circumference of the subject's wasist at a horizontal level around the navel for **men**, and at the level with the smallest width for **women**. Ensure that the subject does not pull their stomach inwards.
- Measure the circumference of the subject's neck starting below the larynx, with the tape cloping downwards to the front. The subject should avoid flaring their neck outwards.
- **For women only**: Measure the circumference of the subject's hips at the largest horizontal measure

Once these measurements are obtained, in inches, the program will use the equations to calculate the body fat percentage for males and females respectively.
